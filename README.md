# NoTanks
A little **multiplayer** game (2 to 4 players)  about tanks fighting in a **top-view** arena. Your objective is simple : destroy your opponents' tanks before your own gets exploded !<br>
This project was entirely developed by me in **Unity** with **C#** as a personal project during my second year of study.
